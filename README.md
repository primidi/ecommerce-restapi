This e-commerce REST API for Web Service built using Node.js as its runtime environment, Express (HTTP Framework), MongoDB (Mongoose Module), and its dependencies.

How to run this app?

If Nodemon is intalled in your PC/Laptop, you can run a command line:
nodemon ./src/index

But if it's not installed already, you can run:
npm i -g nodemon
And then you can run the command line above.

Thank you!
