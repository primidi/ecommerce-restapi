This e-commerce REST API for Web Service built using Node.js as its runtime environment, Express (HTTP Framework), MongoDB (Mongoose Module), and its dependencies.

**How to run this app?**

If Nodemon is intalled in your PC/Laptop, you can run a command line:
_nodemon ./src/index_

But if it's not installed already, you can run:
_npm i -g nodemon_
And then you can run the command line above.

Thank you!
